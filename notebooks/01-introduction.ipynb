    "Imagine you're tracking something over time, like the temperature outside your window every hour, or the number of visitors to a website each day. A **time series** is simply a sequence of measurements taken at regular intervals. The key thing is that the order of the measurements matters, because the value at one point in time is often related to the values that came before it. It's like a story unfolding over time, and we want to understand that story and maybe even predict what happens next."

    "A **time series** can be defined as a sequence of data points, typically real-valued, indexed by time. Let $T$ be the index set representing the time points at which the measurements are taken. For a discrete time series, $T$ is a discrete subset of the real numbers (often the integers or a subset of them, e.g., $T = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$ or $T = \\{t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_n\\}$ where $t_i$ are equally spaced). The time series itself is then denoted as $\\{x_t\\}_{t \\in T}$, where $x_t$ is the observed value at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, a time series can be considered a realization of a stochastic process $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\in T}$, where for each $t \\in T$, $X_t$ is a random variable. The observed sequence $\\{x_t\\}_{t \\in T}$ is one particular outcome of this underlying probabilistic mechanism evolving over time. The analysis of a time series often involves making statistical inferences about the properties of this stochastic process based on the observed data."

    "   - Observing the data, especially the weekly and monthly views, suggests a clear dependency between consecutive data points. For instance, a high energy demand at a particular hour is likely to be followed by a demand that is not drastically different in the next hour. The repeating patterns within the week and month further indicate autocorrelation, where demand at similar times on different days or weeks is correlated. Machine learning models will need to capture this persistence and cyclical dependency to accurately predict future demand."

If we were to shuffle the data points, the inherent patterns related to time (daily peaks and troughs, weekly cycles, seasonal variations across the year) would be lost. Training an ML model on shuffled data would yield meaningless predictions as it would not learn the temporal relationships. When preparing this data for ML, we must maintain its sequential order and split it into training and testing sets based on time."

    "   - The yearly plot shows fluctuations in the overall level of energy demand across the year. There appear to be periods of higher demand (e.g., around March 2024 and potentially towards the end of the year) and lower demand. This suggests the presence of non-stationarity in the mean. While a clear long-term trend might not be immediately obvious from this single year of data, longer timeframes could reveal one. Additionally, the variance of the demand might also change over time, indicating non-stationarity in the variance. Preprocessing techniques might be needed to address these non-stationarities before applying certain ML models."

    "**4. Seasonality and Cyclic Patterns:**\n",
    "   - The monthly plot clearly exhibits a weekly seasonality, with peaks and troughs repeating roughly every 7 days. This is likely due to the difference in energy consumption patterns between weekdays (typically higher demand due to industrial and commercial activity) and weekends (lower demand). The weekly plot further emphasizes this strong weekly cycle, showing a consistent pattern within each week. The yearly plot hints at potential longer-term seasonal patterns across the year (e.g., higher demand in certain months due to heating or cooling needs), although one year of data provides limited insight into inter-annual seasonality."
